# Hardware advice

To do good work you need good tools. And this is my list of recommendations:

## Laptop Windows / Linux:

### [HP EliteBook 840 G9 (5Z6D3EA)](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1850722/hp-elitebook-840-g9-5z6d3ea.html) 

Notes:

* Or another model from the same serie and generation.
* Make sure to buy the separate on site next business day support
* This has a 400 nits screen!
* You can upgrade the memory to 64GB later! It is user replaceable! 


## Portable Display:

### [HP E14 G4](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1672978/hp-e14-g4-wit.htmlhttps://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1672978/hp-e14-g4-wit.html)

## Office display:

### [LG 247UP850N-W](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1874726/lg-27up850n-w-zilver-zwart.html)
