# Hardware advice

To do good work you need good tools. This is my list of recommendations:

## Laptop Linux:

### [Lenovo X1 Carbon](https://www.lenovo.com/nl/nl/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x1/ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Gen-11/p/LEN101T0049) 
* Currently 11th Generation
* I have the 7th and the 10th Generation and they both work flawlessly with Linux
* Make sure to select the on-site next business day support when buying
* Much better build quality and warranty than a Framework laptop


## Laptop Windows:

### [HP EliteBook 840 G9 (5Z6D3EA)](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1850722/hp-elitebook-840-g9-5z6d3ea.html) 
* Or another model from the same series and generation.
* Make sure to buy the separate on-site next business day support
* This has a 400 nits screen!
* You can upgrade the memory to 64GB later! It is user replaceable! 

## Laptop Apple:

### [Apple Macbook Air M2](https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/middernacht-apple-m2-chip-met-8-core-cpu-en-8-core-gpu-256gb)
* Upgrade to 16GB or 24GB memory is required!
* Maximum effective resolution is 1710x1112

## Portable Display:

### [HP E14 G4](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1672978/hp-e14-g4-wit.html)
* This has a 400 nits screen!
* Best with a [Roost Stand](https://www.therooststand.com/) or [Nexstand](https://www.nexstand.nl/)


## Office display:

### [LG 27UP850N-W](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1874726/lg-27up850n-w-zilver-zwart.html)
* There are many different versions of this monitor that are almost the same
* Make sure it has the USB-C power delivery to charge a laptop
* Make sure it is height adjustable

## Smartphones:

### [Samsung Galaxy A54 5G 128GB](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1919102/samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-128gb-opslag-zwart/specificaties/)
* 5 year security updates
* S23 is better but not worth twice the price

## Other:

### [Belkin BoostCharge Pro](https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/1909410/belkin-boostcharge-pro.html)
* 65W charger with 2 USB-C ports
* Really small and light
* Cheaper than [Anker 735 GanPrime 65W](https://www.anker.com/eu-en/products/a2668?ref=naviMenu&variant=42129568661694)

## Opinions:

* Laptops should be 14 inch or larger, smaller has few benefits and many downsides.
* Laptops should have long warranties and preferably on-site support.
* Laptops are mostly the same these days, choose warranty over features or price.
* Portable and laptop screens should be bright. 400 nits minimum.
* Displays should have USB-C power delivery to charge a laptop.
* Most important property of a Smartphone is how long the software support is. iPhones do really well on this.
* Smaller is better for a Smartphone
* Always buy the most recent model of Apple laptops and computers because most get only 7 years of updates.
