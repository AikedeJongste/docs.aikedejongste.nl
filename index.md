Hi!

These are just my personal notes for day to day use. A lot of it is super obvious
but this saves me time and energy because I don't have to think about it and can
just copy it. Also helps when StackOverflow is down. I used to have all this in
Notion.so but this is much faster and has version control.

Will this all be replaced with ChatGPT soon?
