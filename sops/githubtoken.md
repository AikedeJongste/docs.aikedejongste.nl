# Github Token

## Download container images

If you log into Github and go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> you can create a "classic" token there. Maybe this direct link will also work: <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>

You can choose the "note" yourself. And the end date can be, for example, the end of this year.

And after that we need the following permissions:

* write packages
* delete packages

Github automatically adds a few other checkboxes that are needed for that.

If you click on "generate token" at the bottom of the page, you will get a token that looks like this: "ghp_BPkYi8sobCark4TUYTYaa6Z28Ocvkk4Lq88D".

Can you share that with me in secure way?
